This is the final assessment project for Udacity's Nanodegree React Fundamentals course.

This project was initially created based on a started template provide by Udacity.

This project uses a Backend Server from Udacity to provide data.

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## create-react-app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
